Umm working research question:

In the EU's economic relationship with ACP countries, as designated by the [[Samoa Agreement (2023)]], exists there a linear relationship between trade flows and partner-country openness to trade integration?

The working answer is Yes?

- I have to get around to going through the databases.

- I have to go through the EU NDICI and ACP protocols to explain its foreign diplomatic context.

- I have to go through the research on gravity models of trade, either to identify a single working model, or to use a few.

- I have to go through the "New Regionalization" research for general context on that.

- I have to go through research on ACP regionalization for whether I incorporate their context into my research.


**What to do next**

The scripts themselves do not need further structural work. The next step is the writeup. Based on everything in the outputs, the paper has a clear three-part structure: the full-sample stumbling block result (main tables), the trade direction asymmetry (direction table, your most novel finding), and the REC heterogeneity with CEMAC as the building block exception (subsample table and coefficient plot). Everything you need is already estimated and saved. Start with the results section and work backwards to the data and methods — it is easier to write the methods once you know exactly what you are defending.



Do i have to change the countries (i think Mauritania is still in ECOWAS, and should i identify any outliers). Do i need to adjust the years, and what if there is data for missing gaps from outside of CEPii for either BACI or Gravity info. i need to rethink the variables used for both.
