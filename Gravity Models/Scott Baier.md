[Using Machine Learning to Capture Heterogeneity in Trade Agreements](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3)

Until recently, the most common approach employed to quantify the impact of EIAs in the empirical gravity literature was to treat the existence of an EIA between trading partners as an indicator variable (cf. Baier and Bergstrand [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR5 "Baier SL, Bergstrand JH (2007) Do free trade agreements actually increase members’ international trade? J Int Econ 71(1):72–95"); Anderson et al. [2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR2 "Anderson JE, Milot CA, Yotov YV (2011) The incidence of geography on Canada’s services trade. National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA"); Anderson and Yotov [2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR4 "Anderson JE, Yotov YV (2016) Terms of trade and global efficiency effects of free trade agreements, 1990–2002. J Int Econ 99:279–298")). However, this methodology only measured the average treatment effect and did not take into account the fact that EIAs differ extensively in the scope and the level of integration commitments between the parties.

Baier et al. ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR8 "Baier SL, Bergstrand JH, Feng M (2014) Economic integration agreements and the margins of international trade. J Int Econ 93(2):339–350")) provide evidence of the differential effects of different types of trade agreements. They categorize a large number of trade agreements based on their level of economic integration, namely, nonreciprocal preferential trade agreements, reciprocal preferential trade agreements, free trade agreements, customs unions, common markets, and economic unions based on the traditional definition by Frankel et al. ([1995](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR17 "Frankel J, Stein E, Wei S-J (1995) Trading Blocs and the Americas: the natural, the unnatural, and the super-natural. J Dev Econ 47(1):61–95"), [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR18 "Frankel J, Stein E, Wei S-J (1997) Regional Trading Blocs in the World Economic System. Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, DC")). They find that economic unions and common markets are associated with higher levels of bilateral trade compared with nonreciprocal and reciprocal trade agreements. In short, Baier et al. ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR8 "Baier SL, Bergstrand JH, Feng M (2014) Economic integration agreements and the margins of international trade. J Int Econ 93(2):339–350")) were the first to show that more comprehensive trade agreements result in more trade.

Similar to the approach in Baier et al. ([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR8 "Baier SL, Bergstrand JH, Feng M (2014) Economic integration agreements and the margins of international trade. J Int Econ 93(2):339–350")), Baier et al. ([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR7 "Baier SL, Bergstrand JH, Clance MW (2018) Heterogeneous effects of economic integration agreements. J Dev Econ 135(C):587–608")), employing a Melitz-style model, provide evidence that heterogeneity exists across the agreements and that the heterogeneity can be associated with lower fixed trade costs versus marginal trade costs. Baier et al. ([2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11079-022-09685-3#ref-CR9 "Baier SL, Yotov Y, Zylkin T (2019) On the widely differing effects of free trade agreements: lessons from twenty years of trade integration. J Int Econ 116(C):206–226")) use a two-stage approach to account for the heterogeneity in trade agreements. In the first stage, they estimate a gravity equation to measure the trade impact by agreement. They then use these estimates to identify economic, geographical, and political factors associated with the agreements.
