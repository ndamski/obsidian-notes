This is my working directory for a new research project related to identifying the relationship between trade flows and openness to trade integration.
I am looking at, initially, EU trade flows with ACP countries, seeking to code ACP countries as per their integratedness in respective economic unions.
The current work is developing an optimal gravity model of trade equation, a model for integratedness, and a concise database for trade numbers.
