Umm working research question:

In the EU's economic relationship with ACP countries, as designated by the [[Samoa Agreement (2023)]], exists there a linear relationship between trade flows and partner-country openness to trade integration?

The working answer is Yes?

- I have to get around to going through the databases.

- I have to go through the EU NDICI and ACP protocols to explain its foreign diplomatic context.

- I have to go through the research on gravity models of trade, either to identify a single working model, or to use a few.

- I have to go through the "New Regionalization" research for general context on that.

- I have to go through research on ACP regionalization for whether I incorporate their context into my research.
