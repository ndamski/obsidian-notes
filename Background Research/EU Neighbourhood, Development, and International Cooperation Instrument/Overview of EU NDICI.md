[Redesigning Global Europe: The EU’s Neighbourhood, Development, and International Cooperation Instrument](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/redesigning-global-europe-eus-neighbourhood-development-and-international-cooperation)

[NDICI](Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe (NDICI – Global Europe)) as consolidation of [Global Gateway](https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/index_en)

The total allocation for NDICI – Global Europe has been divided as follows:

- €60.38 billion for **geographic programmes**, including at least €19.32 billion for the Neighbourhood. The remainder is allocated for Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas and the Caribbean. This pillar also finances Erasmus+ with an indicative amount of €1.8 billion.
- €6.358 billion for a **thematic programmes** (Human Rights and Democracy; Civil Society Organisations; Peace, Stability and Conflict Prevention; and Global Challenges).
- €3.182 billion for a **rapid response mechanism** that allows the EU to swiftly respond to crises, contribute to peace, stability and conflict prevention, strengthen the resilience of states, societies, communities and individuals, linking humanitarian aid and development action. It will also ensure early action to address Union foreign policy needs and priorities.
- €9.53 billion for **a “cushion” of unallocated funds**, to top up any of the above-mentioned programmes and the rapid response mechanism in case of unforeseen circumstances, new needs, emerging challenges or new priorities.

The NDICI-Global Europe instrument unifies grants, blending and guarantees (the latter previously subject to specific rules and regulations, such as the EIB’s External Lending Mandate), which allows the EU to strategically promote public and private investment worldwide in support to sustainable development through the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+). Investments are backed by an up to €53.4 billion External Action Guarantee, which also covers the pre-accession countries.
