## "Generational Regionalism"
Regionalism in three main ideal-typical cohorts or generations: (i) The operation of a state territory as a ‘single’ market with a related economic policy; (ii) the governance of public goods and the control over resources and power and (iii) the external sovereignty that allows to be an ‘actor’ in international relations. Each cohort is driven by a specific objective or télos - the ideal end-point of integration in that aspect of governance - and materialises in a concrete development process that will not necessarily reach its culmination. Per each cohort, the development will depend on the level of comprehensiveness (in terms of competencies), capacity (in terms of tools), cohesiveness (in terms of identity) and autonomy (from the national level). In theory, a complete and simultaneous integration in all three governance domain would result in the creation of a new supranational polity. 

The first generation of regional integration is characterised by mainly economic integration leading to experiences such as free trade agreements, custom unions, or common markets. These schemes are characterised mainly by “negative integration” - a process of removing the barriers to the free flow of economic factors - and by the widening of the membership included in the process. Actual transfer or pooling of sovereignty, though, can occur, as in the case of custom unions, where a common external tariff is put in place, as well as in monetary unions. The télos of first generation integration is thus the creation of a new single market that comprises the old national markets of each of the participating states.

Second-generation regionalism describes regional schemes where the focus of cooperation is not purely economic but concerns mainly the political sphere, including regulation, redistribution or security; to establish a common approach towards what is usually referred to as ‘internal affairs’: this includes infrastructure, energy and environment policy, but also security policy, social policy, health, employment, research, etc. Also here, the level of integration can vary from superficial political dialogue and coordination, to actual binding regulation and common policies. Further, the process of policy expansion can be accompanied by a process of democratisation of the supranational level, through the creation of parliamentary assemblies, the concentration of interest representation and other instances of input legitimacy and participation. 

In the specific EU case, political (second-generation) cooperation and “positive integration” emerged as a consequence - for instance through functional “spill over” - of the previous negative integration (first-generation), which was failing to achieve a functioning common market. As a broader concept, however, second-generation regionalism can also be an original project not stemming from an economic integration dynamic or anticipating economic integration. Finally, second-generation regionalism, is conceptually introspective, focussing at managing problems that are internal to the regional area. This is not to say that this regionalism is cut off from the outside world. On the contrary, both first and second-generation regionalisms are in many ways responses to the wider globalisation process and to the problems and challenges that derive from it. Furthermore, these types of regionalisms have a presence and impact on the wider international context.9 On the one hand, they can be seen as favouring or hindering global multilateralism, on the other hand, by their mere existence they contribute, to a general process of “contagion”10 of regionalism around the world. Finally, their full accomplishment as internal dynamics creates pressure for external action. e.g. a custom union calls for a common trade policy or a strong common policy on environment will have to be promoted globally.

## "New Regionalism"
According to Van Langenhove ([Citation2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)), regional integration refers to trade integration, development of infrastructures that support an increase in trade affairs, improvement of the private sector, interest in environmental issues, and focus on investments rather than trade creation. There is an underlying debate about whether new regionalism is compatible or not with the multilateral trading system. According to Lamy ([Citation2002](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)), bilateral or regional agreements are complementary to multilateral agreements. In particular, by investigating the European Union he has come to the conclusion that regional agreements are necessary in order for smaller countries to stand on their own feet and at the same time to set up the priorities for multilateralism. The same opinion is shared by Lawrence ([Citation1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)) who mentions that regional agreements do not contradict the multilateral system; instead, they make economies larger and more able to operate in the system. On the other hand, Bhagwaty (1993) finds regionalism incompatible with multilateralism as regional agreements tend to reinforce regional blocks and do not allow other countries to participate in trade affairs. Mansfield ([Citation1998](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)) further supports Bhagwaty by mentioning that regional agreements lead to protectionist measures, creating obstacles in the multilateral system.

The situation altered after the Second World War. In particular, a new wave of regionalism indicated a greater interest in deeper integration among partners that did not pay great attention to geographical boundaries. Geographical proximity lost some of its importance and other criteria appeared. New trade issues emerged, separate from those that existed during ‘old’ regionalism (mostly economic issues). These focused on elements such as intellectual property, competition policies, and environmental and labor issues (Burfisher et al. [Citation2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); Wallis [Citation1994](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); Rakitov and Panagariya [Citation2000](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)). Examples of new regionalism include foreign direct investment so real capital mobility is achieved and at the same time labour mobility is part of deep integration. Furthermore, harmonization of domestic tax, and macro policies and legal regulation are also part of new regionalism. Finally, since deep integration is the final goal, new regionalism includes the establishment of institutions to facilitate integration as well as improvements in communication and transportation infrastructure in order to increase trade mobility (Bergsten [Citation1997](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); Baldwin and Venables [Citation1995](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); Edwards [Citation1993](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)).

A decisive difference between old and new regionalism is the growth in differentiation between physical and functional regions. Physical regions refer to clusters of countries that cooperate due to geographical boundaries while functional regions refer to countries that cooperate due to economic, environmental and cultural boundaries (Searle [Citation1995](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); Bergsten [Citation1997](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)). During the old regionalism period, most regions were clusters of countries with geographical proximity. On the contrary, in the new regionalism period regional relationships pay greater attention to functional and other boundaries rather than to geographical ones (Newman [Citation2001](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#); De Melo and Panagariya [Citation1993](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)). Castells ([Citation1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12143-011-9093-x#)) makes another distinction and refers to “space of places” and “space of flows”, trying to place more emphasis on the changing role of geographical and functional boundaries. However, findings from current research highlight the importance of geographical proximity in initiatives derived from new regionalism.

## Questioning "New Regionalism"
For many scholars in the field, new regionalism can be differen
its predecessor in several ways.4 Andrew Hurrell (1995a: 332) list
jor distinguishing factors. First, NR is very diverse in its nature, co
a range of models/structures/processes of region-building rathe
single norm expected of, and advocated for, first wave regional
neofunctionalists. Second, it can involve partnerships between states in the 'North' and 'South' (i.e. developed and developing countries, respectively), whereas previous regionalisms presupposed only North-North or South-South cooperation. Third, NR varies enormously in the level of institutionalisation of the various regions, whereas 'old' regionalism had a very formal understanding of region-building that saw a lack of new joint institutions as a sign of weakness. Fourth, NR is multi-dimensional, and fundamentally blurs the distinction between the economic and the political, in contrast with its predecessor. Fifth, NR reflects, shapes and requires the development of a regional sense of identity, whereas first wave regionalism, as represented by its European variant, notoriously underplayed and misunderstood issues of legitimacy, identity and popular support.

To this list should be added other factors. Hettne (2000: xxi) argues that
new regionalism is not dependent on spillover for its survival or success,
as instead the policy objectives of the region are set out explicitly at the
outset. Further core features claimed for new regionalism are that unlike
its predecessor(s) it is both global in scope (rather than effectively limited
to Europe), based on economic open-ness/neoliberalism rather than protectionism, independent of superpower politics, and shaped voluntarily by actors from the bottom-up rather than imposed by foreign powers or cultivated by actors at the new centre (on these various points see Hettne, 2002; Söderbaum, 2003)
